    "# Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "> Do you know Python and would like to learn more about functional programming? Are you wondering what the Scala, F#, and Haskell developers are talking about? Let's do some functional programming in a language that you already know!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial that will get you up to speed with functional programming in Python using the [Expression](https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression) functional programming library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is about programming with functions, or *expressions*. An expression is a combination of functions and values that evaluates to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming can sometimes be seen as difficult, scary or even intimidating. Talks about functional programming are often about Applicatives, Functors, and you might have heard about Category Theory or the infamous Monad. But you don't need to know about category theory and Monads to do functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that object-oriented programming can in the same way be just as scary with words such as Inheritance, Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes, Covariance, Contravariance and Liskovs substitution principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at how some object oriented programming patterns maps to functional programming:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*(ref: https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is one takeaway from reading this, it is that functional programming is about expressions (functions and values) that evaluates to a value. This is stuff you most likely already know, and it don't have to be more difficult than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imperative**: `assert a == 10`\n",
    "- **Object-oriented**: `class B: ...`\n",
    "- **Procedural**: `print(\"test\")`\n",
    "- ... and **Functional**: `xs = map(lambda x: x*2, [1, 2, 3])`\n",
    "\n",
    "So Python is not a functional-first programming language, but it has some functional programming features that we will explore in this tutorial.\n",

    "\n",
    "Making pipelines of operations is well known from the Unix terminal and shell programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | .... | command_N\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "F# uses the `|>` operator for piping. The definition of the pipe operator is surprisingly simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```fsharp\n",
    "let (|>) x f = f x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea of pipelining is simply to bring the argument to the left side of the function (instead of the right). The main reason for this is that we are teached to read from left to right. Thus the traditional way of nesting functions is not very easy to read:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "functools.reduce(lambda s, x: s + x, filter(lambda x: x > 100, map(lambda x: x * 10, xs)), 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python do not have a pipe operators and overloading existing operators e.g `|` is not recommended. Expression provides a [pipe](https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression/blob/main/expression/core/pipe.py) function that we can use instead:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "    seq.map(lambda x: x * 10),\n",
    "    seq.filter(lambda x: x > 100),\n",
    "    seq.fold(lambda s, x: s + x, 0),\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to note is that for pipelining to work, then every function can only take a single argument. So how can we provide both e.g a mapper and an iterable for the `seq.map` function? The answer is to use currying or higher-order functions. Remember that a function that takes two arguments is the same as a function that takes the first argument and returns a function that takes the second argument. Here is how the `map` function in the sequence module is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def map(mapper: Callable[[TSource], TResult]) -> Callable[[Iterable[TSource]], Iterable[TResult]]:\n",
    "    def _map(source: Iterable[TSource]) -> Iterable[TResult]:\n",
    "        return (mapper(x) for x in source)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return _map\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to do partial application of functions and have the last function take a single argument. The `pipe` operator in Expression is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def pipe(value: Any, *fns: Callable[[Any], Any]) -> Any:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Functional pipe (`|>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Allows the use of function argument on the left side of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        >>> pipe(x, fn) == fn(x)  # Same as x |> fn\n",
    "        >>> pipe(x, fn, gn) == gn(fn(x))  # Same as x |> fn |> gn\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "    return compose(*fns)(value)\n",

    "## Composition\n",
